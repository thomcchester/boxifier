# boxifier
Take image files of squares and sees if they intersect, contain each other or share a side


# usage:

to use just pull directory, cd into directory. Then run command 
"python boxifier.py <path/to/image/file.jpg>"
on it. This should give you the results to the question you have been asking: "Do these boxes intersect? Are any of them containing eachother?"
